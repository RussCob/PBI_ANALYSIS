# 📦 US Import Data Analysis Project
📋 Project Summary
This project analyzes US Import Shipment Data for 2024 and 2025.
We researched the business requirements, defined column mappings, and generated custom datasets using Python. The script created a CSV file containing the data, which was then used for Power BI analysis and visualization.

Tools used:

Python (for generating raw datasets and exporting them to CSV files)

Power BI (for data modeling and creating interactive dashboards)

Power Query Editor (for data transformation within Power BI)

🛠️ Steps We Followed
Researched import shipment structure and finalized column mappings.

Used Python to generate custom CSV files for 2024 and 2025 datasets.

Imported the CSV file into Power BI.

Added Year column manually within Power BI.

Appended the 2024 and 2025 data into one table: US_ImportData_Full.
